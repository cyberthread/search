## steps to set up a working search bar
1. Log into your Google Account (you cannot use your SUNY Oswego account)
1. Log into the [Google Search Console](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools)
1. Use Google's tutorial on [how to add your URL](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=34592). Be sure to choose the "URL Prefix method"
1. After adding your URL you will need to verify your ownership. I recommend using the HTML tag method that requires you to add one line of code to the head of your index.html file.
